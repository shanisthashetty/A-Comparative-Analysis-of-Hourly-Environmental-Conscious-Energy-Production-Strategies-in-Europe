Comparative Analysis of Environmentally Conscious Energy Production in Europe
Germany • France • Italy • Spain (2015–2022)
A Data-Driven Study of Renewable vs Non-Renewable Energy Trends

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hourly energy production patterns across Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, comparing the adoption of renewable and non-renewable sources over time.
Using a dataset of 475,193 rows sourced from ENTSO-E (European Network of Transmission System Operators) and hosted on Kaggle, the study identifies:

Trends in fossil fuel reduction

Growth in renewable energy sources

Country-specific strengths and gaps

Policy and industry recommendations

The analysis is based on the full research report provided in the repository.

📈 Country-wise Analysis
🇩🇪 Germany

Non-Renewable Trends

Fossil coal dropped from 60M MW to ~30M MW

Fossil gas increased from 5M MW → 25M MW

Nuclear power steadily declined

Renewable Trends

Wind reached 30M MW

Solar increased to 20M MW

Hydro & geothermal remained minimal

➡️ Germany shows strong solar and wind growth but struggles with hydro/geothermal scalability.

🇫🇷 France

Non-Renewable Trends

Fossil hard coal peaked in 2017, then declined

Fossil gas decreased steadily after 2019

Nuclear decreased from 400M MW → ~350M MW

Renewable Trends

Running water remained stable at 40M MW

Solar & wind doubled from 2015–2022

➡️ France relies heavily on nuclear but shows promising solar/wind growth.

🇮🇹 Italy

Non-Renewable Trends

Fossil gas increased from 45M MW → 80M MW

Coal reduced drastically from 50M MW → 10M MW

Renewable Trends

Onshore wind grew to 50M MW

Other renewables remain low

➡️ Italy shows strong de-coalification and consistent wind energy growth.

🇪🇸 Spain

Non-Renewable Trends

Fossil gas rose from 35M MW → 75M MW

Hard coal fell from 45M MW → <10M MW

Nuclear remained constant at 55M MW

Renewable Trends

Onshore wind increased to 60M MW

Hydro remained below 10M MW

➡️ Spain demonstrates strong wind adoption but needs hydro expansion.

🏛 Policy Recommendations
🏢 Government Initiatives

Expand renewable energy incentives

Develop transparent regulatory frameworks

Increase investment in green R&D

🔌 Energy Regulators

Modernize the energy grid

Support cross-country collaboration

Incentivize best-practice sharing

🏭 Industry Stakeholders

Invest in renewable infrastructure

Adopt sustainable operational practices

Reduce carbon footprint with cleaner energy sources

📘 Conclusion

To accelerate the transition toward sustainable energy:

Germany should expand wind/solar and explore hydro/geothermal.

France must reduce dependence on nuclear while scaling solar/wind.

Italy should diversify renewable sources beyond wind.

Spain should complement wind energy with hydro upgrades.

Collaborative European efforts can drive an efficient, low-carbon future and strengthen global sustainability leadership. Based on the full findings in the research paper.
